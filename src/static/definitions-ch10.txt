Regression - Answers if there is a relationship between 2 variables.
Correlation - Answers how strong a linear relationship is.
Residuals - The difference between the actual values and the estimated values.
Independent variable - Also called the explanatory variable or predictor variable, this is the x-value or the input in the equation.
Dependent variable - Also called the response variable, this responds to the independent variable. This is the output.
Linear correlation coefficient - Referred to as r, this is a measure of the strength and direction of the linear relation between two quantitative variables.
Coefficient of Determination - Referred to as r squared, this is the proportion of the variance between two variables.
Variance - Measures how far the data is spread out (the average squared distance from the mean).
Bivariate - Data involving 2 variables. One value of one variable is paired with another value of another variable.
