##### Mean, Median, and Mode

<Indent>

<mark>A data set can have more than one mode.</mark>If there is a tie 
between two values for the most number of times then both values are 
the mode and the data is called bimodal (two modes). If every data point 
occurs the same number of times, there is no mode. If there are more 
than two numbers that appear the most times, then usually there is no mode.

<Spacer/>

If there are extreme values in the data, the median is a better measure 
of the center than the mean. If there are no extreme values, the mean 
and the median will be similar so most people use the mean.

- Weighted Average

    - <InlineMath math={String.raw`\frac{\sum (xw)}{\sum w}`}/>
    {' '} where <InlineMath math="w"/> is the weight of the data value, 
    <InlineMath math="x"/>

<ListSpacer/>

- <WordSpan word="Standard Deviation" definition={wordList['standard deviation']}/>

    - <InlineMath math={String.raw`s = \sqrt{\frac{\sum (x - \bar x)^2}{n - 1}}`}/> 
    {' '} where <InlineMath math={String.raw`\bar x`}/> is the mean and 
    {' '} <InlineMath math="n"/> is the sample size.

<ListSpacer/>

- Population variance

    - <InlineMath math={String.raw`\sigma^2=\sqrt{\frac{\sum(x-\mu)^2}{N}}`}/> 
    where <InlineMath math="\mu"/> (greek letter mu) is the population mean and 
    {' '} <InlineMath math="N"/> is the size of the population.

<mark>Note: The sum of the deviation should always be zero. If is isn't, you made an error.</mark>

##### Ranking

<Indent>

The kth percentile is the data value that has k% of the data at or below that value.

</Indent>

##### Example 3.3.1: Interpreting Percentile

<Indent>
<ListSpacer/>

a) What does a score of the 90<sup>th</sup> percentile mean?
<Indent>
This means that 90% of the scores were at or below this score. (A person did 
the same as or better than 90% of the test takers.)
</Indent>

<Spacer/>

b) What does a score of the 70th percentile mean?
<Indent>
This means that 70% of the scores were at or below this score.
</Indent>

</Indent>

<Spacer/>

##### Example 3.3.2: Percentile Versus Score

<Indent>
<ListSpacer/>

a) If the test was out of 100 points and you scored at the 80th percentile, what was your score on the test?

<Indent>
You donâ€™t know! All you know is that you scored the same as or 
better than 80% of the people who took the test. If all the scores 
were really low, you could have still failed the test. On the other hand, 
if many of the scores were high you could have gotten a 95% or so.

##### Quartiles

<Indent>

To find the quartiles:

1. Sort the data in increasing order.

2. Find the median, this divides the data list into 2 halves.

3. Find the median of the data below the median. This value is Q1.
 
4. Find the median of the data above the median. This value is Q3.

The five-number summary is the minimum, the first quartile (Q1), 
the median, the third quartile (Q3), and the maximum (in that order).
