#### Frequency

<Indent>

| Category | Frequency | Relative Frequency |
| -------- | --------- | ------------------ |
| Ford     | 5         | 0.10               |
| Chevy    | 12        | 0.24               |
| Honda    | 6         | 0.12               |
| Toyota   | 12        | 0.24               |
| Nissan   | 10        | 0.20               |
| Other    | 5         | 0.10               |
| Total    | 50        | 1.00               |

The total of the frequency column should be the number of
observations in the data. The relative frequency is found by taking
the frequency and dividing it by the total.

<PieChart />

A <mark>frequency distribution</mark> lists each category of data how many
times that data occurs.

The <mark>relative frequency</mark> is the proportion (or percent or probability which
is what you are looking at divided by the total amount) of observations
within a category and is found using the formula: <InlineMath math={String.raw`\frac{\text{frequency}}{\sum \text{frequencies}}`}/>

A <mark>relative frequency</mark> distribution lists each category of data
with the relative frequency. It is found using the
formula: <InlineMath math={String.raw`\frac{\text{frequency}}{\text{\# of data points}}`}/>

#### Steps to make a frequency distribution

<Indent>

<ListSpacer />

1. Find the range (max - min)

2. Pick the number of classes to use. Usually this is between 5
   and 20. Pick 5 classes if there is a small amount of data and 20
   classes if there is a lot (think 1,000).

3. Find the class width: <InlineMath math={String.raw`\frac{\text{range}}{\text{\# of classes}}`}/>
   **always** round up to the next whole number.

4. Create the classes. Each class has limits that determine
   which values fall in each class. To find the class limits,
   set the smallest value as the lower class limit for the first
   class then add the class width to the lower class limit to get
   the next lower class limit. Repeat until you get all the classes.
   The upper class limit for a class is one less than the lower limit
   for the next class.

5. Find the class boundary by subtracting 0.5 from lower class limit
   and adding 0.5 to the upper class limit.

6. To find the class boundaries, subtract 0.5 from the lower class
   limit and add 0.5 to the upper class limit.

7. To find the class midpoint (you might not always need it):
   Midpoint = <InlineMath math={String.raw`\frac{\text{lower limit + upper limit }}{2}`}/>

8. To figure out the number of data points that fall in each class,
   go through each data value and see which class boundaries it is between
