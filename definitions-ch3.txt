Range -the difference between the highest and the lowest data values (or maximum and minimum values).
Standard deviation - How far each value is from the mean.
Ranking - A percentile . It represents a location measurement of a data value to the rest of the values.
Variance - Measures how far the data is spread out (the average squared distance from the mean).
