# STA2023
This originally started as a small project to get more comfortable with HTML and CSS but eventually blew up into a full fledged site with React, Sass, and Gatsby. If you'd like to build it, clone this repo and run `npm install` in the root directory. When that finishes run `npm start` and head to local host on your browser.
